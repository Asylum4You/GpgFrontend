# Introduce Features

GpgFrontend provides some advanced functions that can meet the needs of certain
scenarios.

1. **Encryption and Decryption**: You can encrypt files or texts using
   GpgFrontend, which will make your files unreadable to anyone without the
   corresponding key to decrypt them. This is useful for securing sensitive
   data. Similarly, you can decrypt files or texts encrypted with your public
   key. 

2. **Digital Signing and Verification**: GpgFrontend allows you to digitally
   sign your files or text. A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for
   demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message or document. Similarly,
   if someone sends you a signed message or document, you can verify the
   signature to ensure it hasn't been tampered with and confirm the identity of
   the sender.

3. **Key Management**: GpgFrontend enables you to manage all your GPG keys
   conveniently. You can generate, export, import, revoke, and edit your keys.
   It also offers a simple interface for managing your keyring, including your
   public and private keys.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: One of the best features of GpgFrontend is
   its ability to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and
   macOS. This means you can use it no matter what operating system you're
   using, making it an extremely versatile tool.

5. **Open-Source**: Being open-source, GpgFrontend gives you the flexibility to
   modify and distribute the software. This ensures that the software can be
   trusted, as anyone can verify what exactly the software does.

6. **Keyserver Interaction**: GpgFrontend allows for interactions with
   keyservers, facilitating easy sharing of public keys.

7. **User-Friendly Interface**: The software offers an intuitive graphical user
   interface (GUI), making it easier for users to navigate through the software
   and perform tasks.

8. **Compatibility with GnuPG**: GpgFrontend is designed to be a GUI frontend
   for modern GnuPG, meaning it can handle all operations compatible with GnuPG.

These are the primary features as of the current version. As GpgFrontend
continues to evolve, additional features may be added to enhance its
capabilities and user experience.
