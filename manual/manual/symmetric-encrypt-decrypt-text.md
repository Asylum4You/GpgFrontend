# Symmetric Encryption & Decryption of Text

Symmetric encryption is initiated when you click the 'Encrypt' button without
selecting any key in the Key Toolbox. For this type of encryption, a password
must be established for the encryption process. Subsequently, to decrypt the
data, you will need to provide the same password that was used during the
encryption phase.
